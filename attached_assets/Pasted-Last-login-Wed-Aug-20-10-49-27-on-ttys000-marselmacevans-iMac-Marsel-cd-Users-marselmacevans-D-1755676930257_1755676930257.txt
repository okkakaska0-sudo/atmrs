CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/local/share/cmake/Modules/FetchContent.cmake:1953 (message):
  Calling FetchContent_Populate(eigen3) is deprecated, call
  FetchContent_MakeAvailable(eigen3) instead.  Policy CMP0169 can be set to
  OLD to allow FetchContent_Populate(eigen3) to be called directly for now,
  but the ability to call it with declared details will be removed completely
  in a future version.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  CMakeLists.txt:99 (FetchContent_Populate)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

-- Using Kiss FFT for FFT operations
CMake Deprecation Warning at build/_deps/kissfft-src/CMakeLists.txt:35 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.10 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.


-- Building KissFFT with datatype: float
-- Building static library
-- PKGINCLUDEDIR is /kissfft
CMake Error at build/_deps/libsamplerate-src/CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 has been removed from CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value.  Or, use the <min>...<max> syntax
  to tell CMake that the project requires at least <min> but has been updated
  to work with policies introduced by <max> or earlier.

  Or, add -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5 to try configuring anyway.
