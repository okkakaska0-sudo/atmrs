# AutoTune Plugin

## Overview

This is a professional audio plugin project that implements real-time pitch correction (AutoTune) functionality using JUCE framework. The plugin provides multiple pitch correction modes including Classic, Hard, and AI-powered correction using CREPE/DDSP models. It features a comprehensive GUI with parameter controls for speed, amount, key/scale selection, and mode switching. The project is designed to create VST3 and AU plugins for macOS with a professional interface similar to industry-standard pitch correction tools.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Critical requirement: Do NOT simplify the plugin - preserve ALL functionality including:
- Complete audio processing capabilities
- All AI models (ONNX, CREPE, DDSP)
- All mathematical libraries (Eigen3, Kiss FFT, libsamplerate)
- Rubber Band Library integration
- Full VST3 and AU plugin format support
Build environment: Cross-platform build on Replit with full macOS compatibility preservation
Migration status: âœ… COMPLETED - Plugin fully configured for macOS with ALL dependencies installed via Homebrew. Ready for full functionality build including ONNX Runtime, Eigen3, and Rubber Band libraries.
