# AutoTune Plugin

## Overview

This is a professional audio plugin project that implements real-time pitch correction (AutoTune) functionality using JUCE framework. The plugin provides multiple pitch correction modes including Classic, Hard, and AI-powered correction using CREPE/DDSP models. It features a comprehensive GUI with parameter controls for speed, amount, key/scale selection, and mode switching. The project is designed to create VST3 and AU plugins for macOS with a professional interface similar to industry-standard pitch correction tools.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Instructions for New Repository Clone

**CRITICAL: This project is macOS-only. Do NOT attempt Linux builds.**

### Step 1: Install macOS Dependencies
```bash
# Install Homebrew dependencies
brew install eigen onnxruntime rubberband pkg-config cmake
```

### Step 2: Build Plugin
```bash
cd /path/to/project
./build_simple.sh
```

### Current Status
- âœ… All dependencies found and configured for macOS
- âœ… Eigen3: `/usr/local/Cellar/eigen/3.4.0_1/include/eigen3`  
- âœ… ONNX Runtime: `/usr/local/Cellar/onnxruntime/1.22.2_1/`
- âœ… Rubber Band: `/usr/local/Cellar/rubberband/4.0.0/`
- âœ… Build configuration: `CMakeLists_macos_working.txt` (auto-detects libraries)

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Critical requirement: Do NOT simplify the plugin - preserve ALL functionality including:
- Complete audio processing capabilities
- All AI models (ONNX, CREPE, DDSP)
- All mathematical libraries (Eigen3, Kiss FFT, libsamplerate)
- Rubber Band Library integration
- Full VST3 and AU plugin format support
Build environment: macOS ONLY - never attempt Linux/Replit builds
Migration status: âœ… COMPLETED - Plugin fully configured for macOS with ALL dependencies installed via Homebrew.

## System Architecture

### Core Framework Architecture

- **Terminal Build Scripts**: Automated build process via `./build_simple.sh` command

## ðŸŽ¯ For AI Assistant: Project Context

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT:**
- This project builds ONLY on macOS with native tools
- All dependencies are installed via Homebrew at specific paths
- Use `CMakeLists_macos_working.txt` configuration (auto-detects libraries)
- Run `./find_dependencies.sh` to verify library locations
- Build script: `./build_simple.sh` (fixes macOS-specific paths)

**NEVER:**
- Attempt Linux builds or Replit compilation
- Simplify functionality or remove AI features
- Use generic dependency paths - use discovered Homebrew paths

**CURRENT BUILD FILES:**
- Primary config: `CMakeLists_macos_working.txt` 
- Build script: `build_simple.sh`
- Dependency finder: `find_dependencies.sh`

The architecture supports professional-grade real-time audio processing with multiple correction modes, AI-enhanced pitch detection, and a modern user interface designed to compete with industry-standard pitch correction tools like Antares Auto-Tune.
